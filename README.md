This is a project I created using Java Swing for my Java Programming Language course in North South Univerity.
Based on arcade games in the 90's this is a shooter game that takes place in space. Aim for the highest score possible 

1. Download the "SpaceShoot executable" folder and run the jar file to play the game.
2. The Source code is contained in the "SpaceShootWithWindow" folder.
